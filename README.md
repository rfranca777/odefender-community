### *"Because your CISO shouldn't need to worry about tag management at 2 AM."*

<br/>

## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

Let's be honest: **security maturity is expensive — not because of licenses, but because of time.**

Every enterprise running Microsoft Defender, Sentinel, or any modern security stack faces the same reality:

> *Hundreds of servers. Dozens of subscriptions. Thousands of alerts. And a team that spends more time configuring tools than actually defending the organization.*

**End-to-end protection** is the gold standard, but achieving it requires enormous administrative effort:

- 🏷️ Manually classifying and tagging servers across MDE
- 📋 Creating and maintaining Device Groups for differentiated policies
- 🔍 Tracking inactive, duplicate, and ephemeral machines
- 📊 Building reports that CISOs actually want to read
- 🔄 Repeating it all. Every. Single. Day.

**What if you could automate 90% of that work?**

That's why **ODefender Community** exists.

---

## 💡 What We Build

We create **open-source, enterprise-grade automation packages** that turn complex security operations into **zero-touch workflows**.

Every project follows the same philosophy:

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| 🔒 **End-to-End** | Complete solutions, not half-baked scripts |
| 📖 **Documented to the Bone** | Analysts LEARN while they automate |
| 🧪 **Battle-Tested** | Every package runs in real enterprise environments first |
| 🎯 **Report-First** | Always see what WOULD change before anything happens |
| 🤖 **Agent-Ready** | Designed for AI agent integration (coming soon) |
| 🌍 **Open & Inclusive** | Microsoft ecosystem + third-party integrations |

> *We don't just give you a script. We give you a complete solution with architecture diagrams, technical documentation, implementation checklists, and the confidence to deploy on Monday morning.*

---

## 📦 Projects

### 🏷️ [MDE-ServerTags](https://github.com/rfranca777/MDE-ServerTags) — `v2.2.0` ✅ Production Ready

> **Automated Server Classification for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**

Automatically classify and tag your **entire server fleet** in MDE based on Azure subscriptions, lifecycle state, and health status. Creates the foundation for differentiated security policies per environment — with **zero daily effort**.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**⏱️ Before (Manual)**
- 4-6 hours/week managing tags
- Error-prone manual classification
- Stale data, missed duplicates
- No lifecycle tracking
- "Who changed that tag?" — nobody knows

</td>
<td width="50%">

**⚡ After (MDE ServerTags)**
- 0 hours/week — fully automated
- Deterministic, auditable classification
- Daily sync, always current
- Lifecycle: Inactive, Ephemeral, Duplicate
- Complete CSV/HTML reports every run

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Key Numbers**:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Lines of PowerShell | 8,400+ |
| Validation Stages | 10 (E2E automated test) |
| Subscription Discovery | 4-level fallback (CSV → ARM → CLI → MDE) |
| Supported Platforms | Windows Server + Linux (Ubuntu, RHEL, SUSE, Oracle, Debian) |
| Time to First Tag | ~15 minutes from clone to production |

👉 **[Get Started →](https://github.com/rfranca777/MDE-ServerTags)**

### 🔮 Coming Soon

| Project | Description | ETA |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| 🤖 **MDE-ServerTags AI Agents** | Autonomous agents for machine cleanup: auto-offboard `INATIVO_40D`, investigate `DUPLICADA_EXCLUIR`, manage ephemeral fleet | Q3 2025 |
| 📊 **Sentinel-Analytics-Pack** | KQL query packs with MITRE ATT&CK mapping, PCI-DSS / NIST correlation, and auto-generated executive reports | Q3 2025 |
| 🔗 **Defender-3rd-Party-Bridge** | Integration patterns for CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Palo Alto, and other third-party tools with Microsoft Sentinel | Q4 2025 |
| 📋 **Security-Posture-Baseline** | Automated security posture assessment against CIS Benchmarks, with remediation playbooks | Q4 2025 |
| 🛡️ **Endpoint-Hardening-Pack** | GPO/Intune templates for endpoint hardening with validation scripts and rollback support | 2026 |

> *Each project will follow the same standard: complete documentation, E2E tests, report-first approach, and AI agent integration.*

---

## 🤖 The AI Agent Vision

We believe the future of security operations is **human-directed, agent-executed**.

The current version of MDE ServerTags **identifies** issues — but a human still needs to act on them. Our roadmap changes that:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    TODAY                    TOMORROW                  │
│                                                                      │
│  DUPLICADA_EXCLUIR  → Manual review        → AI Agent auto-offboards │
│  INATIVO_40D        → Manual investigation → AI Agent verifies + acts│
│  EFEMERO            → Manual cleanup       → AI Agent manages fleet  │
│  Device Groups      → Manual portal work   → AI Agent creates + tunes│
│                                                                      │
│  Human Role:   Execute tasks ──────────►   Review & approve          │
│  Agent Role:   (none)        ──────────►   Execute + report          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> *The goal: analysts spend their time on **strategic planning and threat hunting**, not on tag management and machine cleanup.*

**Rafael França**  
**Customer Success Architect — Cyber Security @ Microsoft**

I work with enterprises every day helping them unlock the full potential of Microsoft's security ecosystem. These projects are born from the real challenges I see in the field — the repetitive, time-consuming tasks that keep talented security teams from doing what they do best.

> *"Empowering every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more."*  
> *This isn't just Microsoft's mission — it's mine. Sharing knowledge is the foundation of every strong defense.*

These publications aim to **support people and organizations** in reaching higher security maturity, making end-to-end protection accessible — not just aspirational.
