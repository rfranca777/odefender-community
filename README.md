### *"Because your CISO shouldn't need to worry about tag management at 2 AM."*

<br/>

## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

Let's be honest: **security maturity is expensive — not because of licenses, but because of time.**

Every enterprise running Microsoft Defender, Sentinel, or any modern security stack faces the same reality:

> *Hundreds of servers. Dozens of subscriptions. Thousands of alerts. And a team that spends more time configuring tools than actually defending the organization.*

**End-to-end protection** is the gold standard, but achieving it requires enormous administrative effort:

- 🏷️ Manually classifying and tagging servers across MDE
- 📋 Creating and maintaining Device Groups for differentiated policies
- 🔍 Tracking inactive, duplicate, and ephemeral machines
- 📊 Building reports that CISOs actually want to read
- 🔄 Repeating it all. Every. Single. Day.

**What if you could automate 90% of that work?**

That's why **ODefender Community** exists.

## 💡 What We Build

We create **open-source, enterprise-grade automation packages** that turn complex security operations into **zero-touch workflows**.

Every project follows the same philosophy:

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| 🔒 **End-to-End** | Complete solutions, not half-baked scripts |
| 📖 **Documented to the Bone** | Analysts LEARN while they automate |
| 🧪 **Battle-Tested** | Every package runs in real enterprise environments first |
| 🎯 **Report-First** | Always see what WOULD change before anything happens |
| 🤖 **Agent-Ready** | Designed for AI agent integration (coming soon) |
| 🌍 **Open & Inclusive** | Microsoft ecosystem + third-party integrations |

> *We don't just give you a script. We give you a complete solution with architecture diagrams, technical documentation, implementation checklists, and the confidence to deploy on Monday morning.*

## 📦 Projects

### 🏷️ [MDE-ServerTags](https://github.com/rfranca777/MDE-ServerTags) — `v2.2.0` ✅ Production Ready

> **Automated Server Classification for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**

Automatically classify and tag your **entire server fleet** in MDE based on Azure subscriptions, lifecycle state, and health status. Creates the foundation for differentiated security policies per environment — with **zero daily effort**.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**⏱️ Before (Manual)**
- 4-6 hours/week managing tags
- Error-prone manual classification
- Stale data, missed duplicates
- No lifecycle tracking
- "Who changed that tag?" — nobody knows

</td>
<td width="50%">

**⚡ After (MDE ServerTags)**
- 0 hours/week — fully automated
- Deterministic, auditable classification
- Daily sync, always current
- Lifecycle: Inactive, Ephemeral, Duplicate
- Complete CSV/HTML reports every run

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Key Numbers**:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Lines of PowerShell | 8,400+ |
| Validation Stages | 10 (E2E automated test) |
| Subscription Discovery | 4-level fallback (CSV → ARM → CLI → MDE) |
| Supported Platforms | Windows Server + Linux (Ubuntu, RHEL, SUSE, Oracle, Debian) |
| Time to First Tag | ~15 minutes from clone to production |

👉 **[Get Started →](https://github.com/rfranca777/MDE-ServerTags)**

---

### ⚙️ [MDE-PolicyAutomation](https://github.com/rfranca777/MDE-PolicyAutomation) — `v1.0.4` ✅ Production Ready

> **Azure Policy + Intune Groups + MDE Device Tags — Zero-Touch Governance**

Deploy **one script** and get a complete governance stack: Azure Policy auto-tags every Windows VM, an Automation Account syncs VMs to Entra ID groups every hour, and MDE Device Groups apply differentiated AV/ASR policies per environment — with **zero portal clicking**.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**⏱️ Before (Manual)**
- MDE portal: one big unsorted device list
- No differentiated policies per environment
- New VMs go untagged for weeks
- Intune groups manually created, always stale
- New subscription = a full day of portal work

</td>
<td width="50%">

**⚡ After (MDE PolicyAutomation)**
- MDE Device Groups per subscription — automatic
- PROD/DEV/TEST → different AV/ASR policies
- Azure Policy tags VMs at creation time
- Entra groups synced every hour via Automation
- New sub → run script → 10 min → done forever

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Key Numbers**:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Deployment Stages | 14 (fully autonomous) |
| Lines of PowerShell | 1,350+ |
| Azure Resources Created | 8 (RG, AA, Group, Identity, RBAC, Runbook, Policy, Schedule) |
| Sync Frequency | Hourly (configurable) |
| Platform Support | Windows + Cloud Shell |
| Time to Full Deployment | ~10 minutes from clone to production |

Select from **62 normatives** spanning ISO, GDPR, LGPD, HIPAA, SOX, NF-e, and regional standards from 6 continents — with SMTP email alerts, admin password protection, and a built-in violation log. **Free forever. No cloud required.**

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**⏱️ Before (Manual)**
- Files named inconsistently across teams
- Compliance audits fail due to naming violations
- GDPR/LGPD filenames expose sensitive data classification
- Manual review of hundreds of files per audit
- Different naming rules per country, per project

</td>
<td width="50%">

## 🤖 The AI Agent Vision

We believe the future of security operations is **human-directed, agent-executed**.

The current version of MDE ServerTags **identifies** issues — but a human still needs to act on them. Our roadmap changes that:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    TODAY                    TOMORROW                  │
│                                                                      │
│  DUPLICADA_EXCLUIR  → Manual review        → AI Agent auto-offboards │
│  INATIVO_40D        → Manual investigation → AI Agent verifies + acts│
│  EFEMERO            → Manual cleanup       → AI Agent manages fleet  │
│  Device Groups      → Manual portal work   → AI Agent creates + tunes│
│                                                                      │
│  Human Role:   Execute tasks ──────────►   Review & approve          │
│  Agent Role:   (none)        ──────────►   Execute + report          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> *The goal: analysts spend their time on **strategic planning and threat hunting**, not on tag management and machine cleanup.*

**Rafael França**  
**Customer Success Architect — Cyber Security @ Microsoft**

I work at Microsoft helping enterprises unlock the full potential of the security ecosystem — from Defender for Endpoint to Sentinel, from Intune governance to end-to-end protection strategies. These projects are born from real-world challenges I see every day in the field: talented security teams spending more time configuring tools than actually defending their organizations.

**Why I share this publicly:**

I believe that **knowledge shared is defense multiplied**. Security maturity shouldn't be a privilege reserved for organizations with unlimited budgets and headcount. By open-sourcing the patterns, automations, and architectures I build with customers, I hope to raise the security baseline for everyone — from enterprise SOCs to one-person security teams.

> *"Empowering every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more."*  
> *This isn't just Microsoft's mission — it's mine. Every script published here is a step toward making end-to-end protection accessible, not just aspirational.*

## 🌍 The Bigger Picture

This initiative isn't limited to Microsoft-only shops. Our vision includes:

- **🔗 Third-party integrations** — Bridge Microsoft Defender/Sentinel with CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Palo Alto, and other market leaders
- **📚 Knowledge democratization** — Every package includes technical explanations so analysts understand *why*, not just *how*
- **📊 Strategic output** — Final reports designed for executive consumption, enabling CISOs to make data-driven decisions
- **🌐 Multi-language** — Documentation in English and Portuguese (Brazil)

> *We want security teams to spend more time planning and less time configuring. More time investigating and less time clicking through portals. More time protecting and less time reporting.*
